# DiGA Thesaurus

The Digitization of Gandharan Artefacts Thesaurus

## About

This repository contains an extensive thesaurus for the description and cataloguing of Gandharan and – more generally – Buddhist art. It was initially developed for the [DiGA Project](https://diga.ceres.rub.de/en/ "Digitization of Gandharan Artefacts"). It is based on the _Repertorio Terminologico per la schedatura delle sculture dell’arte gandharica_ by Domenico Faccenna and Anna Filigenzi, converted to SKOS by Frederik Elwert, and then substantially revised and extended by Serena Autiero and Jessie Pons. For a detailed description, see [this blog post](https://digartefacts.hypotheses.org/14).

The main URI of the SKOS concept scheme is <https://w3id.org/diga/terms>. A SKOSMOS instance is provided for browsing.

## Contributing

Other projects are already starting to use the Thesaurus. We accept contributions that add missing concepts which are relevant for the description of Buddhist art. The focus of the thesaurus is currently on South and Central Asia. We are open for discussions regarding the inclusion of concepts for other regions and traditions, e.g. East Asia.

If you want to discuss the use of the thesaurus, you can do so in our [Matrix Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#thesauri:ruhr-uni-bochum.de). Please request access via <diga-project@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>.

We also accept pull requests on this repository. Contributions should be made directly in the turtle files. `diga_terms_skosmos.ttl` is not meant to be edited directly, but is generated automatically by running `normalize.py -s`.

## Funding

The project on which the thesaurus is based was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research under the funding code 01UG2048X. The authors are responsible for the content of this publication.
